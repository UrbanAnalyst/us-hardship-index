# US Hardship Index

`us-hardship-index` is an R package for calculating a hardship index for
specified US states, using data from the US Census Bureau's *American Community
Survey*. It includes the single primary function `hs_hardship_index()`, which
accepts the two parameters of:

- "state" for the desired US state; and
- "year" for the desired year (with values available since 2010).

The index itself is calculated from the methodology of "*An Update on Urban
Hardship*," by Lisa M. Monteil, Richard P. Nathan, and David J. Wright (2004),
*The Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Goverment*. It is formed as a multiple
of the following six measures, each standardised to unit (or percentage)
scales:

- *occupancy*: Proportion of rooms with > 1 occupant per room;
- *poverty*: Proportion of households below poverty line;
- *unemployment*: Proportion of unemployed adults;
- *no_hs*: Proportion of population without highschool diploma
- *deps*:  Proportion of population who may be considered dependent; that is
  either under 18 or over 65
- *income*: Per-capita income

All variables are quantified such that lower values are better, except for
income. The hardship index is then simply the product of those six metrics,
again standardised to a unit (or percentage) scale. An example of the index in
action is provided by [the city of Chicago](
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2/data),
as a table of the six metrics plus their conversion to a composite hardship
index.

## Access to Census Bureau Data

This package requires an API key for census.gov, which can be obtained from
[the Census Bureau's website](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).
This key should be stored as an environment variable named `CENSUS_API_KEY`,
generally by specifying its value in the `~/.Renviron` file. Alternatively, the
key can be set with the [`tidycensus` function,
`census_api_key()`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/reference/census_api_key.html).
